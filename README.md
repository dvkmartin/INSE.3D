# INSE3D

To run the application download and unzip the Foodwise project, then navigate to: \Foodwise\dist and run Foodwise.jar

Javadoc is located in the dist folder as well: \Foodwise\dist\javadoc

Notes: Two libraries are used for the test cases and those are Junit and Hamcrest. JUnit is the directly used library while the Hamcrest library is used internally by the Junit. Both the libraries are present in the test librarires folder and may need to be reimported in case of any errors in automatic import of project in netbeans

If loading the project in the Netbeans IDE you may come across to a prompt that mentions that the Junit & Hamcrest libraries are missing. If this is the case, click the "JUnit library can not be found" line and click resolve. This will open an installer to install the latest JUnit version. Once that is installed the hamcrest library missing issue can be ignored by simply closing "Resolve Project Problems" prompt.
