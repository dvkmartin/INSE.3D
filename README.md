To run the application download and unzip the Foodwise project, then navigate to: \Foodwise\dist and run Foodwise.jar

Javadoc is located in the dist folder as well: \Foodwise\dist\javadoc

Notes: Two libraries are used for the test cases and those are Junit and Hamcrest. JUnit is the directly used library while the Hamcrest library is used internally by the Junit. Both the libraries are present in the test librarires folder and may need to be reimported in case of any errors in automatic import of project in netbeans
